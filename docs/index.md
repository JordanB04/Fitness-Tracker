This documentation site contains the API reference for the Fitness Tracker sample application.

- The API reference is generated from the `FitnessTracker.Api` project and the XML documentation it produces.

## How the site is organized

- Home: this page
- API Reference: generated under the `api/` section once you run the doc generation step.

## Quick links

> Note: Build the project first so the XML documentation file is available (see `docs/README_BUILD.md`).
